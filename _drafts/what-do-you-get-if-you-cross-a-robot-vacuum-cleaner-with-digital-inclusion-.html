<p>On my way back from the local Parkrun this morning I nipped into our local Aldi to pick up a few groceries (OK, some bacon for a post-run butty!) As I made my way towards the tills, I glanced in the Special Buys section, AKA the bargain bins. There were the usual random items like discounted grass seed, cycle gear, heavy duty shelving but today there was something else that caught my eye:</p>
<p>It really was the last thing I was expecting to see in a "discount" supermarket. What was once the future of household chores, lorded in tech magazines and TV gadget shows has now become available to the masses at a cutdown price. (Disclaimer- I have no idea how good the actual vac is)</p>
<p>Seeing this item sparked off the beginnings of this blog and it made me think about the pace of technological change. This was quite a fitting end to the week, given that only a few days ago I'd spent some time with a wonderful group of self-titled silver surfers in preparation for my upcoming talk on ongo's digital inclusion work.</p>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting June, Julie, Derek and their volunteer digital coach Steve at one of ongo's internet taster sessions. Their reason for being there was quite simple - they recognised that getting online and learning about how they could better use their computers was of benefit <strong>to them</strong>. They each had individual aims too such as learning how to Skype friends in New Zealand, how to download free sheets of music to help them with their guitar playing or just getting to know their way around their computer more.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we had an insightful discussion on topics such as pace of change, what worried them about technology and why previous computer classes hadn't worked for them. A common theme from them was a lack of trust in conducting their affairs online such as online banking because of security breaches - perhaps this was slightly biased, given mass media coverage on the same day that eBay had asked all users to change their passwords.</p>
<p>On the subject of previous computer classes, they'd explained about the impersonal experience they'd received, using computers in a lab environment which were alien to them. The difference from their current session was that they were able to bring in their own devices and their own problems, to have them resolved in an intimate setting. Not only did they bring their laptops, but their mobile devices too.</p>
<p>When talking about pace of change (and heading back to back to the vac story), all of them recognised that technology was becoming readily available to all but it didn't mean to say they wanted to embrace it, unless they felt a need to.</p>
<p>So I guess we can provide our customers with affordable tech such as the Â£X tablet, we can encourage them to channel shift onto digital plaforms <del>by making it harder to for them to contact us via traditional channels</del>, but is this still just a case of leading the proverbial horse to H2O?</p>
<p>There are still two major barriers for us to try and break down - a lack of trust in the technology and a lack of desire to use it in the first place - unless an individual's passion or problem can be enhanced online. Granted, this problem will improve as the so-called Gen Y become older but given that #ukhousing still has customers from older generations who still haven't touched a computer (let alone a robot vacuum cleaner), we all still have a hell of a lot to do.</p>
<p>We certainly don't know the secret or have a magic bullet for all of this, but by beginning with what our digitally excluded customers <em>want</em> to do online, rather than <em>what we think</em> they should be doing seems to be a good place to start in trying to get them to think about using our digital services later.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>To learn more about ongo's approach to digital inclusion such as what's worked and what hasn't then I recommend you book a place on the Capital X Conf. Hope to see you there.</p>
