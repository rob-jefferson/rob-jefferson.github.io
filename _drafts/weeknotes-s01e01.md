First week back after paternity leave.
Along with the obvious task of looking after yet another little one, my passion for coding was reignited with the launch of this site and lots of self-study on Javascript libraries and framework such as React and Vue.

Read (and listened) a lot about the rival camps when it comes to web development in 2019 - seperation of form, function and design or component-based combined development using JS.

Meetings, meetings and more meetings.

Design, web projects (100 things)
