Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

I do have &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertjefferson.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;a blog&lt;/a&gt; but just a quick check through the archives reveals an average of one or two posts per year. Although the posts themselves are fairly comprehensive and thoughtful (even if I do say so myself) given the irregular posting it‚Äôs not surprising that it‚Äôs hardly a hive of activity or engagement. Instead of WOL through long form blog posts, I‚Äôve tended to focus more on microblogging via &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/robjefferson&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-a-fresh-start&quot;&gt;üåü A fresh start&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this website is hopefully the start of something new. It‚Äôs been a bit of a pet project that‚Äôs brought together some long-overdue personal development on different projects; creating a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.robjefferson.uk/brush-your-teeth/&quot;&gt;progressive web app&lt;/a&gt;, version control with Git (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rob-jefferson&quot;&gt;using GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, which is also hosting this very website via GitGub Pages), Boostrap 4 (as I‚Äôve previously been using version 3) and now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs also introduced me to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dillinger.io/&quot;&gt;Dillinger&lt;/a&gt; which is the web app I‚Äôm writing this blog post on. It‚Äôs a snazzy Markdown editor that integrates directly with GitHub so is effectively acting as a basic CMS for my site. Actually, that‚Äôs probably not right - it‚Äôs more of a publishing system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Ô∏è-but-why&quot;&gt;‚ÅâÔ∏è But, why?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this work has scratched a very deep itch I‚Äôve had for some time to get back into (basic) web development. Spending a LOT of time focusing on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/i/moments/1052554813484015616&quot;&gt;stand out social media content&lt;/a&gt; over the last 12-18 months, along with becoming more strategic in a new role at work has meant I‚Äôve had less time to tinker with code. It‚Äôs frightening how quickly you can get left behind. The last time I spent this long dabbling with anything more than minor CSS and HTML changes was back in Dreamweaver days. Frameworks, CSS pre-processors are all things I‚Äôve tinkered with but not really used in anger‚Ä¶until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-taking-back-control&quot;&gt;üí™ Taking back control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding ‚ÄúBrexity‚Äù, this site is also a culmination of a desire to take back control of my own content by embracing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/&quot;&gt;IndieWeb&lt;/a&gt;. Although &lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/POSSE&quot;&gt;I‚Äôll be syndicating my posts, ideally automatically&lt;/a&gt;, to the usual suspects including twitter and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@RobJefferson/&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;, the longer term aim is to ‚Äú&lt;a href=&quot;https://indieweb.org/backfeed&quot;&gt;backfeed&lt;/a&gt;‚Äù likes, replies, reposts to my site. By copying these interactions to the original content on this site, I can, quote: ‚Äúsave them from numerous silo-content-loss scenarios from malevolent censorship to eventual site-death‚Äù. In other words, in future years when commercially owned websites/services change their operating model / lose the faith of the masses / shut down entirely, I‚Äôll still have a copy of everything. This is the theory anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;Ô∏è-onwardsÔ∏è&quot;&gt;‚ñ∂Ô∏è OnwardsÔ∏è&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully &lt;del&gt;this site&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;my&lt;/strong&gt; site will encourage me to work out loud more again. I‚Äôve long admired the &lt;a href=&quot;https://weeknot.es/&quot;&gt;weeknotes format&lt;/a&gt; and I‚Äôm a regular reader of some of the juicy stuff published by the likes of &lt;a href=&quot;https://neiltamplin.me/@neiltamplin&quot;&gt;Neil Tamplin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@satorilabben&quot;&gt;Ben Proctor&lt;/a&gt; et al.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RobJefferson/status/1009800260162646016&quot;&gt;asked the good folk of  twitter&lt;/a&gt; if they would be interested in reading more about what I do. 91% of the 22 people who kindly replied to my poll said they &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; like to so hopefully this is the start of that. I‚Äôm not sure about doing it weekly but we‚Äôll see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance to the 9% who don‚Äôt. üëç&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Rob Jefferson</name></author><summary type="html">I‚Äôve been pretty slack over the last few years when it comes to working out loud (WOL).
