# Welcome to the source code of my personal website
This website is hopefully the start of something new.

It’s been a bit of a pet project that’s brought together some long-overdue personal development on different projects; creating a progressive web app, version control with Git using GitHub,, Boostrap 4 (as I’ve previously been using version 3) and now, Jekyll.

It’s also introduced me to Forestry to quicken publishing and tinker further.
