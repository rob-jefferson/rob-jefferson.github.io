<p>I think it's about time I started to blog more again. This site has been woefully neglected over the last year or so so I'm going to commit to writing more of my thoughts down on here.<!--more--> Previously, this blog was called STEP (Society, Technology, Education and Politics). At the time, I was working in the education sector but now I'm in housing so I've got to come up with some sort of name change I guess. Not quite sure STHP works so well. Answers on a postcard (comments feed!) for a new name for the blog.</p>
