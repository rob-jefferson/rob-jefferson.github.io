I've now managed to get [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) linked up to my GitHub/Jekyll install. It's taken a bit of time to master but seems to be working fine now. Only thing that's not quite right is the [Jekyll Menu](https://github.com/forestryio/jekyll-menus) plugin. It seems to work fine on the preview, it's just in the live environment that it doesn't seem to be working. I'm hoping posting this will force a rebuild of the site and get it working. ðŸ¤ž
