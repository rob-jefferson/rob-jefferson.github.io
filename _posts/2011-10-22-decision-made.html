<p>Well, after a lot of thought I've finally decided to "bite the bullet" and set up my own blog. Over time I'll be publishing essays, research, interesting articles I come across on the internet and anything else I think people may wish to read about.<!--more--> I won't be offended if you don't like something. That's down to you.</p>
<p>Basically, if you're interested in society, education, politics or technology then hopefully you'll find what I put on here of some use to you.</p>
