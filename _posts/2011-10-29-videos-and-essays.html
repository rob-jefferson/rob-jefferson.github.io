<p>I've created a couple of new pages on this site which will host a show-reel from video productions I've produced, filmed and edited over the years.<!--more--> I've already put a couple of videos on there now of the two Lindsey Lodge Hospice Sleepwalk charity events that I've covered in recent years.</p>
<p>Secondly, I've added a page for Research and Publications which will host essays and research from my bachelors degree course and anything else academic that I may be lucky enough to be involved with in future. The aim is to get something published in a journal in future, not to bore you to death with poor quality essays but I've got to start somewhere! Who knows, you might find some of it insightful or even useful. If you do find my work useful then please credit me in your citation.</p>
