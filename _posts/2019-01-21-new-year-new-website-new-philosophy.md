I've been pretty slack over the last few years when it comes to [working out loud](https://workingoutloud.com/) (WOL). I do have [a blog](https://robertjefferson.wordpress.com) but just a quick check through the archives reveals an average of one or two posts per year. Although the posts themselves are fairly comprehensive and thoughtful (even if I do say so myself) given the irregular posting it's not surprising that it's hardly a hive of activity or engagement. Instead of WOL through long form blog posts, I've tended to focus more on microblogging via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/robjefferson).

## 🌟 A fresh start

So, this website is hopefully the start of something new. It's been a bit of a pet project that's brought together some long-overdue personal development on different projects; creating a [progressive web app](https://www.robjefferson.uk/brush-your-teeth/), version control with Git ([using GitHub](https://github.com/rob-jefferson), which is also hosting this very website via GitGub Pages), Boostrap 4 (as I've previously been using version 3) and now, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

It's also introduced me to [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/) which is the web app I'm writing this blog post on. It's a snazzy Markdown editor that integrates directly with GitHub so is effectively acting as a basic CMS for my site. Actually, that's probably not right - it's more of a publishing system.

## ⁉️ But, why?

All this work has scratched a very deep itch I've had for some time to get back into (basic) web development. Spending a LOT of time focusing on [stand out social media content](https://twitter.com/i/moments/1052554813484015616) over the last 12-18 months, along with becoming more strategic in a new role at work has meant I've had less time to tinker with code. It's frightening how quickly you can get left behind. The last time I spent this long dabbling with anything more than minor CSS and HTML changes was back in Dreamweaver days. Frameworks, CSS pre-processors are all things I've tinkered with but not really used in anger...until now.

## 💪 Taking back control

At the risk of sounding "Brexity", this site is also a culmination of a desire to take back control of my own content by embracing the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/). Although [I'll be syndicating my posts, ideally automatically](https://indieweb.org/POSSE), to the usual suspects including twitter and [Medium](https://medium.com/@RobJefferson/), the longer term aim is to "[backfeed](https://indieweb.org/backfeed)" likes, replies, reposts to my site. By copying these interactions to the original content on this site, I can, quote: "save them from numerous silo-content-loss scenarios from malevolent censorship to eventual site-death". In other words, in future years when commercially owned websites/services change their operating model / lose the faith of the masses / shut down entirely, I'll still have a copy of everything. This is the theory anyway.

## ▶️ Onwards️

Hopefully ~~this site~~ **my** site will encourage me to work out loud more again. I've long admired the [weeknotes format](https://weeknot.es/) and I'm a regular reader of some of the juicy stuff published by the likes of [Neil Tamplin](https://neiltamplin.me/@neiltamplin) and [Ben Proctor](https://medium.com/@satorilabben) et al.

I recently [asked the good folk of  twitter](https://twitter.com/RobJefferson/status/1009800260162646016) if they would be interested in reading more about what I do. 91% of the 22 people who kindly replied to my poll said they _would_ like to so hopefully this is the start of that. I'm not sure about doing it weekly but we'll see.

Apologies in advance to the 9% who don't. 👍
