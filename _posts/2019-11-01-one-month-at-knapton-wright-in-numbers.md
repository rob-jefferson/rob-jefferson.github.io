This week I hit the one month mark at [Knapton Wright](https://www.knaptonwright.co.uk). Where the hell did that time go? When you break it down into numbers, it’s quite staggering.

📛 3 conferences ([Tech Expo Humber](https://techexpohumber.com/), [Business Hive Live](https://twitter.com/KnaptonWright/status/1180150427733639169) and [CommsCamp North](https://twitter.com/RobJefferson/status/1186924065094864897))

🤝 9 meetings with current and prospective clients, including a marketing reboot session and two kick-off sessions

🌎 1 transatlantic conference call with an established client

🧶 2 [matching sweaters and cars](https://twitter.com/KnaptonWright/status/1180049309045313542)

🗣️ 1 [presentations to new public sector clients](https://twitter.com/RobJefferson/status/1184178076504248320) on social media and tone of voice

☕ 23(ish) coffees courtesy of our new coffee machine

💨 1 [speed networking event and dinner with Melanie Onn MP](https://twitter.com/hhchamber/status/1185142884594524163) and Hull & Humber Chamber of Commerce

👥 2 catch-ups with potential collaborators

💷 1 [meeting with the accountant](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6595729341676691456-7dWX) (and as a result, I’m now a #fintech geek)

🤓 1 new financial system learned played with.

🧾 34 outstanding expense receipts processed (you’re welcome, Alex)

🎓 1 team training session on Google Ads

📻 1 meeting with a radio station about some cool ad tech

And most importantly,

🍻 1 PAWF (pint after work friday)

Life at Knapton Wright is clearly busy. It’s an ambitious company and it’s growing week by week. It’s also a fun, enjoyable and harmonious place to work. None of this is surprising though - [I recognised these things early on in my conversations with co-founders Alex and Louise](https://robjefferson.uk/2019/09/16/dexit-what-next.html#-why-knapton-wright) and these were the big reasons why I wanted to join.

One thing I hadn’t anticipated though is just how great it is to be back in Brigg and North Lincolnshire. [I was interviewed on my first day about my connections to the place](https://knaptonwright.co.uk/knapchat-rob-jefferson/) but it’s only now I’m back that I’ve realised how much I’ve been missing it, and how strong my affinity is to it.

Similarly, to be able to reconnect with old friends, colleagues and connections from previous roles has been fantastic. I’ve really enjoyed making new contacts too. Despite initial reticence with it being completely new to me, the speed networking event was a surprising highlight.

What I’ve enjoyed most though is the freedom the role now allows me to team up with people I admire and organisations who truly want to invest time (alright, and money - I’m a businessman now) improving what they do.

This is what I want to do more of over the coming months, **so if you’ve got a project in mind, a problem to solve or a creative conundrum to overcome and you think my team and I can help you with it, please do get in touch** [**by email**](mailto:rob@knaptonwright.co.uk)**,** [**DM on twitter**](https://twitter.com/robjefferson) **or** [**inbox on LinkedIn**](http://www.linkedin.com/in/robjjefferson) **or** [**sticky-note ferret**](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Maildor-Modou-Sticky-Notes-Ferret/dp/B00N97IM1A)**.**
